# Django-learning
I am uploading this project as I've learned Django framework by working at this project , 
its a simple ecommerce project with all functionalities made using core django and python.
Its UI is not so attractive because i wanted to focus more on backend but the backend code is perfectly done.
I am also learning about Django - rest_framework , I've worked on it in this project , normal API - CRUD operations.
